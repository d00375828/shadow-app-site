# Shadow App — Pages

Public pages for App Store Connect (TestFlight & App Store):

- **Privacy Policy:** `/privacy`  
- **Support:** `/support`

This repo is set up for GitHub Pages using Markdown (no build step).

## Quick start

1. Create a new public repo on GitHub (e.g., `shadow-app-site`).
2. Add these files to the repo root:
   - `privacy.md`
   - `support.md`
   - `README.md`
   - `.gitignore`
   - `LICENSE`
3. Enable GitHub Pages: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch**, set **Branch** to `main` and **Folder** to `/ (root)`.
4. After it deploys, your links will be:
   - Privacy: `https://<your-username>.github.io/shadow-app-site/privacy`
   - Support: `https://<your-username>.github.io/shadow-app-site/support`

You can rename the repo later; the URLs will change accordingly.
